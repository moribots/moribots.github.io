Thanks for stopping by! I'm **Maurice**, a Roboticist from [Bcharre, Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bsharri).

I currently work for [Boston Dynamics](https://www.bostondynamics.com) on the Controls team for the [Stretch](https://www.bostondynamics.com/stretch) project.

I graduated from **Northwestern**'s Master of Science in Robotics program! My interests within Robotics include controls, path planning, and hardware.


My most recent project involved the full-stack development of a $600 open source [quadruped platform](https://moribots.github.io/project/spot-mini-mini) for accessible reinforcement learning tasks.

Aside from Robotics, I love playing guitar, hiking, and cold plunges!
