Thanks for stopping by! I'm **Maurice**, a Roboticist from **Lebanon**. 

After completing my BEng in Electrical & Mechanical Engineering, I decided to enroll in **Northwestern**'s Master of Science in Robotics program! My interests within Robotics include legged locomotion, path planning, SLAM, and active prosthetics. My most recent project involved the full-stack development of a $600 open source **quadruped platform** for accessible reinforcement learning tasks.


I'm currently gearing up to start working on the **Handle** team at **Boston Dynamics**!

Aside from Robotics, I love playing guitar, hiking, and cold plunges!
