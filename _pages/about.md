Thanks for stopping by! I'm Maurice, an aspiring Roboticist from Lebanon. 

After completing my BEng in Electrical & Mechanical Engineering, I decided to enroll in Northwestern's Master of Science in Robotics program! My interests within Robotics include SLAM, path planning, legged locomotion, and active prosthetics. My next project is to deploy a dynamically stable gait onto a Minitaur robot to implement ORB-SLAM2 using its stereo camera!

I perform my best work in small, tight-knight teams that are ambitious and innovative. 

Aside from Robotics, I love playing guitar, hiking, and cold plunges! 

I am currently looking for full-time work in Autonomous Vehicles, Robot Locomotion, and Robotics R&D. I am open to relocation.
