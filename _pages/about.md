Thanks for stopping by! I'm Maurice, an aspiring Roboticist from Lebanon (34.24°N, 36.01°E). 

After completing my BEng in Electrical & Mechanical Engineering, I decided to enroll in Northwestern's Master of Science in Robotics program! My interests within Robotics include path planning, legged locomotion, and active prosthetics. My current project is to use Reinforcement Learning to teach a bipedal robot how to walk!

I perform my best work in small, tight-knight teams that are autonomous, ambitious and innovative. 

Aside from Robotics, I love playing guitar, hiking, and cold plunges! 

I am currently living in Chicago, and will be available for full-time work beginning September 2020.
