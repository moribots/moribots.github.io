Thanks for stopping by! I'm **Maurice**, a Roboticist from [Bcharre, Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bsharri).

I currently work for [Boston Dynamics](https://www.bostondynamics.com) remotely from Detroit, MI. I am on on the Manipulation team for the [Stretch](https://www.bostondynamics.com/stretch) project, and am responsible for motion generation. To date, my code has helped Stretch move >6 million customer boxes.

I graduated from **Northwestern**'s Master of Science in Robotics program! My interests include motion planning (optimization or ML based) and any kind of modeling that can improve my understanding of a system.


Aside from Robotics, I love playing guitar, hiking, and cold plunges!
