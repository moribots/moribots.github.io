## RRT

Two versions were developed. First, a goal-oriented RRT was implemented with circular obstacles. Next, an image was used to represent the domain's obstacles, which were avoided by implementing Bresenham's Line Algorithm.

A Rapidly Expanding Random Tree (RRT) algorithm for path planning can be summarised with the following pseudo-code:

![rrt](/images/Projects/mlai-rrt/rrt_code.png)

* RANDOM_CONFIGURATION selects a random coordinate in the domain.
* NEAREST_VERTEX finds the vertex in the tree closest to the random coordinate, according to some metric, in this case Euclidian.
* NEW_CONFIGURATION generates a new configuration in the tree by moving distance Δ from the nearest vertex to the randomly selected one.

## A* (Naive + Online)

As a form of best-first search, A* evaluates neighbouring nodes using $f(n)=g(n)+h(n)$ where $g(n)$ (usually equal to 1, although $\sqrt{2}$ for diagonal paths showed better performance) is the traversal cost from the current node n to the neighbour node being evaluated, and h(n) is the heuristic cost, which estimates the cheapest path from the current node $n$ to the goal node. Hence, for any given step, the neighbouring node with the lowest f (n) cost will be chosen. If two nodes have the same f (n) cost, they are evaluated by whichever has the lowest h(n) cost [1]. A* search is both complete, meaning that it will always find a solution if one exists, and optimal, meaning that it will always find the cheapest solution in a given set of solutions. For this to be true, the heuristic cost function h(n) must be admissible, meaning that it must never over-estimate the cost to reach the goal. Furthermore, h(n) must be consistent, meaning that the h(n) of parent nodes must always be non-decreasing. Since g(n) represents the true cost to reach a node along a path, an admissible heuristic cost results in f (n) never over-estimating the true cost to the goal [1]. In a grid that allows diagonal movement (i.e each node has a maximum of 8 neighbours), a viable heuristic is the Diagonal Distance Heuristic: $h(n) = D1 ∗ (dx + dy) + (D2 − 2 ∗ D1) ∗ min(dx, dy)$.

For this project, a naive (basic) A* is implemented for the two figures below, with the expanded nodes shown in black for grid cell sizes of 1 and 0.1 respectively.

Next, an online A* algorithm was implemented to emulate real path planning on a real robot which cannot sense obstacles untill they take up nodes adjacent to it. The figures below show the path traced on a unicycle-modeled robot controlled with a proportional controller, whose heading is portrayed using green arrows. The second figure shows an artificially-induced replan case, whereby the robot's position was perturbed where the jump is visible. This is to show the robustness of the algorithm.
