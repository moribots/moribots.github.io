During the 2017 Formula Student UK competition at silverstone, I managed the Aerodynamics & Ergonomics branch of my university's Formula Student team. Despite having an internship at Jaguar Land Rover that summer, my manager gave me clearance to take time off and join my team as long as I helped out with JLR's presence at Silverstone (they are a primary sponsor of FSUK).

Just after our endurance race, I was approached by FISITA, who asked me a few questions about the FSUK experience!
