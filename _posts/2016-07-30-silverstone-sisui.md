## A Great Year with a Great Team

In my first year at the University of Edinburgh, I joined the newly founded formula student team, Edinburgh University Formula Student (EUFS). I designed and manufactured the bodywork and head restraint for the car (see below), and assisted in general manufacturing as well. We were a small team at the time, and everyone worked overtime, especially during the days leading up to the competition. Despite having by far the smallest budget at Silverstone, we were able to pass scrutineering, and only fell short due to an Engine failure during the brake test. Despite this, and for our stark determination, we were given the 'Spirit of Formula Student' award, which was released for the first time in 2016.

The video below shows our shock and awe at receiving the news!
